Start your django server and mongoDB.

Open model_testing.py and change the value of the host string to the ip and port the django server is running at.

All the test cases are stored as dictionaries in test_data.md.

When you run model_testing.py for the first time, you will be asked to enter your api auth token.

Once you get to the terminal, type help to get the list of commands available for testing.

Every command corresponds to the appropriate function call of the api.

To change the data in the test cases, change the appropriate dictionary and save test_data.md. Now enter the command "refresh data" to load the new test cases.
